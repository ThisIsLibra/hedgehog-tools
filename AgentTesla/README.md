# AgentTesla Config Extractor

Usage:

`python AgentTesla_config_extractor.py <folder_with_samples>`

Configs will be placed or appended to a file named agenttesla_configs.txt

For sample hashes look at the extracted configs.

Works on non-packed samples, so use unpacme or similar before applying the extractor.
